        <p>
          Prince Rogers Nelson (June 7, 1958 â€“ April 21, 2016), better known as
          Prince, was an American singer-songwriter, musician, record producer,
          dancer, and actor. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest
          musicians of his generation. A multi-instrumentalist who was
          considered a guitar virtuoso, he was well known for his eclectic work
          across multiple genres, flamboyant and androgynous persona, and wide
          vocal range which included a far-reaching falsetto and high-pitched
          screams.
