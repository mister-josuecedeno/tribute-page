## Objective

Build a tribute page using HTML and CSS only. Ensure that the page complies with the fundametals of UI design.

## Challenges

Ensuring that images match the layout can be challenging. To ensure that the image adjusted to the screen layout the following code was leveraged

```
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  height: 500px;
  width: 100%;
}
```
